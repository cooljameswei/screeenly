            <h2 class="material--display-1">Is this service free?</h2>
            <p class="material--body-1">Yes. Screeenly is free.</p>
            <p class="material--body-1">However, if Screeenly would get really popular and we would run into server problems, we would have to find a solution on how to keep the servers alive. Maybe there will come a paid plan (with more features?) but early adopters can use this service for free forever.</p>

            <h2 class="material--display-1">What about the screenshots?</h2>
            <p class="material--body-1">All screenshots someone creates via Screeenly have a lifetime of <strong>7 days</strong>! After this time the file will be deleted from our server. Forever.</p>

            <p class="material--body-1">Concering privacy, Screeenly is hosted on <a href="http://uberspace.de">Uberspace</a>, a German hosting solution. All images remain on those servers and never leave Europe.</p>

            <h2 class="material--display-1">Why does this service exist?</h2>
            <p class="material--body-1">Screeenly is a side project of <a href="http://stefanzweifel.io">Stefan Zweifel</a>. I was not happy with current solutions on the internet, so I built my own service and made it open to the public and published the source code to <a href="http://github.com/_stefanzweifel/screeenly">Github</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="material--display-1">I have a problem. How can I reach you?</h2>
            <p class="material--body-1">You can always send us an <a href="mailto:hello@screeenly.com">Email</a>, a <a href="http://twitter.com/screeenly">Tweet</a> or leave your Feedback <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rSfWcUrPCf2Ony3blKh6L3dOQiIanVKU0HZ0Org4eFs/viewform?usp=send_form">here</a>.</p>
            <p class="material--body-1">Due to the fact, that we just started, there might be some bugs or things that are missing, but we will add those in the upcoming weeks.</p>

            <h2 class="material--display-1">How can I support you?</h2>
            <p class="material--body-1">You can do different things:
            <ul>
                <li>Make a pull-request on Github</li>
                <li>share us on all those social networks</li>
                <li>Send us <a href="mailto:hello@screeenly.com">emails</a></li>

            <h2 class="material--display-1">Good to know</h2>
