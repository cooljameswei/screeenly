Screeenly is an open sourced web-app / API to create screenshots from websites.
Sideproject by [Stefan Zweifel](http://stefanzweifel.io).

If you want to use the API in your PHP project I wrote a simple package. Checkout [screeenly-client](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/ScreeenlyClient) for more information.
